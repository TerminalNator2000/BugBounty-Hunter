# BugBounty-Hunter

**BugBounty-Hunter** is an advanced vulnerability detection and reporting application designed for bug bounty hunters and cybersecurity professionals. It leverages the power of fine-tuned language models like LLM4Vuln to analyze code, detect vulnerabilities, and generate professional bug reports.

## 🚀 Features

- **Automated Vulnerability Detection**:
  - Analyze code snippets, APIs, and recon data for vulnerabilities.
  - Leverages LLM4Vuln datasets fine-tuned for vulnerability identification.
  
- **Professional Bug Reports**:
  - Generates detailed, reproducible bug reports.
  - Includes severity analysis, risk ratings, and suggested mitigations.

- **Streamlined Workflow**:
  - Preprocess raw data and tokenize for fine-tuning or inference.
  - User-friendly CLI and web interface for interaction.

- **Seamless Bug Reporting**:
  - API integrations with platforms like HackerOne and Bugcrowd.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**:
  - Backend: Hugging Face Transformers, Flask (optional UI)
  - Frontend: Streamlit (interactive UI)
- **Storage**:
  - SQLite for data management.
  - File-based storage for logs and reports.
- **Deployment**: Dockerized for easy portability and deployment.

   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

### Usage

1. **Run the CLI Tool**:
   ```bash
   python app/main.py
   ```

2. **Preprocess Data**:
   Use the provided preprocessing script to clean and tokenize datasets:
   ```bash
   python app/utils/preprocess.py
   ```

3. **Fine-Tune the Model**:
   Use the `training_notebook.ipynb` for fine-tuning the model with your data.

4. **Generate Reports**:
   Once vulnerabilities are detected, generate a professional bug report.

### Deployment
